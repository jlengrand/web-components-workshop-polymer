# Introduction to Web Components

This repo was created to support [a technical workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Coffee-Code-and-Chat/events/245662648/) given in Utrecht in December 2017.

Each index file represents a simple exercise meant to show a given aspect of **[Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/)**.

This repository contains the **[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)** introduction part of the talk.
